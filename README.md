# SQL_Music_store_analysis
In this guided project, we will be working with a database called music_store_database which contains information about a fictional music store. The database includes several tables on invoice information, track, album, artist, and genre data, and employee and customer information related to the storeâ€™s sales. We will use this PostgreSQL database and pgAdmin4 tool in order to explore and analyze three fictional sets of Business questions and Propositions. Questions consist of three sets(easy, moderate, and advanced). Each set of levels consists of questions with their answers and images of the following output.

## Database and Tools
